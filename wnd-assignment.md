# WND assignment

Hello and welcome to the WND tech assignment!

In this project, we want you to develop an e-commerce shopping page.

The assignment is divided into two parts, and we expect you to use the
technologies described below:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Vue routing](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/routing.html)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) / [redaxios](https://openbase.com/js/redaxios)
- [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/guide/design.html)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
  
To get the mock data, you should use [dummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs).

From all the available data you need to use `/products` and `/users` but you
are free to choose more data.

## PART I

On the first part of the project we want you to create three different pages
with header.

The main page, where the user will be able to see the highlighted products as
bestsellers. On each product across the application it is mandatory that you
showcase the user that is selling it (association between product and user
is up to you, and could be random).

The second page, where the user will be able to see all listed products
depending on the category, price, rating, and more parameters that you might
find interesting to have as filters.

The third page, would be a detailed view of the item (after clicking an item)

You are free to do the header component the way you desire.

## PART II

The second part consists of having a functionality to buy items. You also need to
create another page (or modal) to showcase the basket and manage the quantity of
items to buy.

There you can unselect items, add more, and have an overview of the total price.

There's also the need of persisting the data of the basket, and have a checkout
button that deletes this persisted data.

## NOTES

User authentication is not required in this project

You're free to use any design you want, but we advise you to make a mockup first
using your preferred platform.

Besides the technologies required, you can use others that you feel comfortable
working with.

You have one week to complete the project and do your best.
When finished just sent us a link of Git project.

Have fun!
